## Ingredients

## Directions

1. Pre-heat the oven at 160 degrees celcius and grease the baking pan. 
2. Mix the sifted dry ingredients in a mixing bowl.
3. Pour the liquid ingredients into the bowl. 
4. Using a wooden spoon, mix the ingredients until the mixture is smooth.
5. Transfer the mixture into the greased pan. 
6. Place it in the oven and bake it for 40 - 45 minutes. To check if it's done, put a toothpick in the brownies, and if no crumbs stick to the toothpick after you pull it out, it's done. 
7. The brownies are done! Enjoy eating!
